### Psnap Interface for Prosilica cameras
###
### 07/27/09

The Psnap interface can be build as follow:

make sample; make install;

this is the same pattern used to build the prosilica examples

* All the Python code can be found on the folder ./Python

* The folder ./Prosilica should contain all the folders from the Prosilica SDK 
  it actually contains the SDK 1.20 for Linux, if you have a different OS change this folder and hope....

* Modify the conf file for your architecture

* Should work fine on 64bit machines (never tried)


  from the Prosilica README

* For best streaming performance, the examples and your application should be run as superuser.

* The MTU of the GigE adapter should be changed to accommodate for Jumbo frames using the 'ifconfig' command. The syntax is as follow:

> sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 8228
